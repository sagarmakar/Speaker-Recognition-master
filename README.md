# Speaker-Recognition
Automatic Speaker Recognition algorithms in Python

This repository contains Python programs that can be used for Automatic Speaker Recognition. ASR is done by extracting MFCCs and LPCs from each speaker and then forming a speaker-specific codebook
of the same by using Vector Quantization, Or NN-Clustering. 
Put in the train data-set in train folder and test data-set in test folder.

Run using:
	pip install -r requirements.txt
	python3 test.py, For testing
	python3 train.py, For training

Reffer to the project report for more understanding. I have also attached a ppt for presentation.
